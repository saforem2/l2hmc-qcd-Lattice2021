@article{Abadi:2016kic,
	abstract = {TensorFlow is an interface for expressing machine learning algorithms, and an implementation for executing such algorithms. A computation expressed using TensorFlow can be executed with little or no change on a wide variety of heterogeneous systems, ranging from mobile devices such as phones and tablets up to large-scale distributed systems of hundreds of machines and thousands of computational devices such as GPU cards. The system is flexible and can be used to express a wide variety of algorithms, including training and inference algorithms for deep neural network models, and it has been used for conducting research and for deploying machine learning systems into production across more than a dozen areas of computer science and other fields, including speech recognition, computer vision, robotics, information retrieval, natural language processing, geographic information extraction, and computational drug discovery. This paper describes the TensorFlow interface and an implementation of that interface that we have built at Google. The TensorFlow API and a reference implementation were released as an open-source package under the Apache 2.0 license in November, 2015 and are available at www.tensorflow.org.},

	abstract = {A Markov chain update scheme using a machine-learned flow-based generative model is proposed for Monte Carlo sampling in lattice field theories. The generative model may be optimized (trained) to produce samples from a distribution approximating the desired Boltzmann distribution determined by the lattice action of the theory being studied. Training the model systematically improves autocorrelation times in the Markov chain, even in regions of parameter space where standard Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms exhibit critical slowing down in producing decorrelated updates. Moreover, the model may be trained without existing samples from the desired distribution. The algorithm is compared with HMC and local Metropolis sampling for \$\textbackslash phi\^4\$ theory in two dimensions.},

The ideas and approaches proposed in arXiv:1904.12072, arXiv:2002.02428, and arXiv:2003.06413 are reviewed and a concrete implementation of the framework is presented. We apply this framework to a lattice scalar field theory and to U(1) gauge theory, explicitly encoding gauge symmetries in the flow-based approach to the latter.

	abstract = {Recently, there have been many works on the deep learning of statistical ensembles to determine the critical temperature of a possible phase transition. We analyze the detailed structure of an optimized deep learning machine and prove the basic equalities among the optimized machine parameters and the physical quantities of the statistical system. According to these equalities, we conclude that the bias parameters of the final full connection layer record the free energy of the statistical system as a function of temperature. We confirm these equalities in one- and two-dimensional Ising spin models and actually demonstrate that the deep learning machine reveals the critical temperature of the phase transition through the second difference of bias parameters, which is equivalent to the specific heat. Our results disprove the previous works claiming that the weight parameters of the full connection might play a role of the order parameter such as the spin expectation.},

@article{benyDeepLearningRenormalization2013,
	abstract = {Renormalization group (RG) methods, which model the way in which the effective behavior of a system depends on the scale at which it is observed, are key to modern condensed-matter theory and particle physics. We compare the ideas behind the RG on the one hand and deep machine learning on the other, where depth and scale play a similar role. In order to illustrate this connection, we review a recent numerical method based on the RG--the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA)--and show how it can be converted into a learning algorithm based on a generative hierarchical Bayesian network model. Under the assumption--common in physics--that the distribution to be learned is fully characterized by local correlations, this algorithm involves only explicit evaluation of probabilities, hence doing away with sampling.},

@article{betancourtConceptualIntroductionHamiltonian2018,
	abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo has proven a remarkable empirical success, but only recently have we begun to develop a rigorous understanding of why it performs so well on difficult problems and how it is best applied in practice. Unfortunately, that understanding is confined within the mathematics of differential geometry which has limited its dissemination, especially to the applied communities for which it is particularly important. In this review I provide a comprehensive conceptual account of these theoretical foundations, focusing on developing a principled intuition behind the method and its optimal implementations rather of any exhaustive rigor. Whether a practitioner or a statistician, the dedicated reader will acquire a solid grasp of how Hamiltonian Monte Carlo works, when it succeeds, and, perhaps most importantly, when it fails.},

	abstract = {Unsupervised learning of probabilistic models is a central yet challenging problem in machine learning. Specifically, designing models with tractable learning, sampling, inference and evaluation is crucial in solving this task. We extend the space of such models using real-valued non-volume preserving (real NVP) transformations, a set of powerful, stably invertible, and learnable transformations, resulting in an unsupervised learning algorithm with exact log-likelihood computation, exact and efficient sampling, exact and efficient inference of latent variables, and an interpretable latent space. We demonstrate its ability to model natural images on four datasets through sampling, log-likelihood evaluation, and latent variable manipulations.},

@article{duanTransportMonteCarlo2019,
	abstract = {In Bayesian inference, transport map is a promising alternative to the canonical Markov chain Monte Carlo for posterior estimation: it uses optimization to find a deterministic map from an easy-tosample reference distribution to the posterior. However, the invertible map often does not exist between the two distributions; and it can be challenging to parameterize with sufficient flexibility. Motivated to address these issues and substantially simplify its use, we propose Transport Monte Carlo. Instead of relying on a single deterministic map, we consider a coupling joint distribution modeled by a non-parametric mixture of several maps. Such a coupling is guaranteed to exist between the reference and posterior distributions. To automate the map parameterization and estimation, we use the invertible neural networks to replace the manual design procedure. Once the coupling is estimated, one can rapidly generate a large number of samples that are completely independent. With a carefully chosen reference distribution, the difference between the generated samples and the exact posterior is negligibly small. Both theoretic and empirical results demonstrate its advantages for solving common but challenging sampling problems.},

	abstract = {Machine learning has been a fast growing field of research in several areas dealing with large datasets. We report recent attempts to use Renormalization Group (RG) ideas in the context of machine learning. We examine coarse graining procedures for perceptron models designed to identify the digits of the MNIST data. We discuss the correspondence between principal components analysis (PCA) and RG flows across the transition for worm configurations of the 2D Ising model. Preliminary results regarding the logarithmic divergence of the leading PCA eigenvalue were presented at the conference and have been improved after. More generally, we discuss the relationship between PCA and observables in Monte Carlo simulations and the possibility of reduction of the number of learning parameters in supervised learning based on RG inspired hierarchical ansatzes.},

@article{Goodfellow:2014upx,
	abstract = {We propose a new framework for estimating generative models via an adversarial process, in which we simultaneously train two models: a generative model G that captures the data distribution, and a discriminative model D that estimates the probability that a sample came from the training data rather than G. The training procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to 1/2 everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation. There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference networks during either training or generation of samples. Experiments demonstrate the potential of the framework through qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the generated samples.},

Using complementary priors, we derive a fast, greedy algorithm that can learn deep, directed belief networks one layer at a time, provided the top two layers form an undirected associative memory. The fast, greedy algorithm is used to initialize a slower learning procedure that fine-tunes the weights using a contrastive version of the wake-sleep algorithm. After fine-tuning, a network with three hidden layers forms a very good generative model of the joint distribution of handwritten digit images and their labels. This generative model gives better digit classification than the best discriminative learning algorithms. The low-dimensional manifolds on which the digits lie are modeled by long ravines in the free-energy landscape of the top-level associative memory, and it is easy to explore these ravines by using the directed connections to display what the associative memory has in mind.},

We present a general strategy to overcome this difficulty by adopting ideas and techniques from the machine learning community. We fit the unnormalized probability of the physical model to a feedforward neural network and reinterpret the architecture as a restricted Boltzmann machine. Then, exploiting its feature detection ability, we utilize the restricted Boltzmann machine for efficient Monte Carlo updates and to speed up the simulation of the original physical system. We implement these ideas for the Falicov-Kimball model and demonstrate improved acceptance ratio and autocorrelation time near the phase transition point.},

	abstract = {We apply unsupervised machine learning techniques, mainly principal component analysis (PCA), to compare and contrast the phase behavior and phase transitions in several classical spin models - the square and triangular-lattice Ising models, the Blume-Capel model, a highly degenerate biquadratic-exchange spin-one Ising (BSI) model, and the 2D XY model, and examine critically what machine learning is teaching us. We find that quantified principal components from PCA not only allow exploration of different phases and symmetry-breaking, but can distinguish phase transition types and locate critical points. We show that the corresponding weight vectors have a clear physical interpretation, which is particularly interesting in the frustrated models such as the triangular antiferromagnet, where they can point to incipient orders. Unlike the other well-studied models, the properties of the BSI model are less well known. Using both PCA and conventional Monte Carlo analysis, we demonstrate that the BSI model shows an absence of phase transition and macroscopic ground-state degeneracy. The failure to capture the `charge' correlations (vorticity) in the BSI model (XY model) from raw spin configurations points to some of the limitations of PCA. Finally, we employ a narticlear unsupervised machine learning procedure, the `antoencoder method', and demonstrate that it too can be trained to capture phase transitions and critical points.},

@article{Ioffe:2015ovl,
	abstract = {Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating narticlearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization. It also acts as a regularizer, in some cases eliminating the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batchnormalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.9\% top-5 validation error (and 4.8\% test error), exceeding the accuracy of human raters.},

Comparison is made to the Metropolis thermalization algorithm using both the Wilson and Manton actions. The heatbath algorithm is found to outperform the Metropolis algorithm in both execution speed and decorrelation rate. Results, mostly in D=3, for N=2 through 5 at several values for the inverse coupling are presented.},

@article{Kaya:2018lar,
	abstract = {Real Space Renormalization Group (RSRG) treatment of Ising model for square and simple cubic lattice is investigated and critical coupling strengths of these lattices are obtained. The mathematical complications, which appear inevitable in the decimated partition function due to Block-spin transformation, is treated with a relevant approximation from outset. The approximation is based on the approximate equivalence of \$\textbackslash ln(1+f(K,\textbackslash\{\textbackslash sigma\_\{n.n\}\textbackslash\})) \textbackslash simeq f(K,\textbackslash\{\textbackslash sigma\_\{n.n\}\textbackslash\})\$ for small \$f(K,\textbackslash\{\textbackslash sigma\_\{n.n\}\textbackslash\})\$, here \$K\$ is the nearest neighbor coupling strength and \$\textbackslash\{\textbackslash sigma\_\{n.n\}\textbackslash\}\$ is the nearest neighbor spins degrees of freedom around a central spin. The values of the critical coupling strengths are obtained as \$0.4830\$ for square lattice and \$0.2225\$ for simple cubic (SC) lattice. The corresponding critical exponents values \$\textbackslash alpha\$ and \$\textbackslash nu\$ are also calculated within very acceptable agreement with those values obtained from numerical works},

@article{Kingma:2013hel,
	abstract = {How can we perform efficient inference and learning in directed probabilistic models, in the presence of continuous latent variables with intractable posterior distributions, and large datasets? We introduce a stochastic variational inference and learning algorithm that scales to large datasets and, under some mild differentiability conditions, even works in the intractable case. Our contributions is two-fold. First, we show that a reparameterization of the variational lower bound yields a lower bound estimator that can be straightforwardly optimized using standard stochastic gradient methods. Second, we show that for i.i.d. datasets with continuous latent variables per datapoint, posterior inference can be made especially efficient by fitting an approximate inference model (also called a recognition model) to the intractable posterior using the proposed lower bound estimator. Theoretical advantages are reflected in experimental results.},

The topological charge density generates a finite gap at \$\texttheta{}=\ensuremath{\pi}\$ toward the thermodynamic limit. In addition finite size scaling analysis of the topological susceptibility up to \$V=L\textbackslash times L=1024\textbackslash times 1024\$ allows us to determine the phase transition at \$\texttheta{}=\ensuremath{\pi}\$ is the first order.},

@article{leeScientificStatisticalModelling2020,
abstract = {This paper addresses two fundamental features of quantities modeled and analysed in statistical science, their dimensions (e.g. time) and measurement scales (units). Examples show that subtle issues can arise when dimensions and measurement scales are ignored. Special difficulties arise when the models involve transcendental functions. A transcendental function important in statistics is the logarithm which is used in likelihood calculations and is a singularity in the family of Box-Cox algebraic functions. Yet neither the argument of the logarithm nor its value can have units of measurement. Physical scientists have long recognized that dimension/scale difficulties can be side-stepped by nondimensionalizing the model -- after all, models of natural phenomena cannot depend on the units by which they are measured-- and the celebrated Buckingham Pi theorem is a consequence. The paper reviews that theorem, recognizing that the statistical invariance principle arose with similar aspirations. However, the potential relationship between the theorem and statistical invariance has not been investigated until very recently. The main result of the paper is an exploration of that link, which leads to an extension of the Pi-theorem that puts it in a stochastic framework and thus quantifies uncertainties in deterministic physical models.},

Our method generalizes Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and is trained to maximize expected squared jumped distance, a proxy for mixing speed. We demonstrate large empirical gains on a collection of simple but challenging distributions, for instance achieving a 106x improvement in effective sample size in one case, and mixing when standard HMC makes no measurable progress in a second. Finally, we show quantitative and qualitative gains on a real-world task: latent-variable generative modeling. We release an open source TensorFlow implementation of the algorithm.},

@article{liNeuralNetworkRenormalization2018,
	abstract = {We present a variational renormalization group (RG) approach using a deep generative model based on normalizing flows. The model performs hierarchical change-of-variables transformations from the physical space to a latent space with reduced mutual information. Conversely, the neural net directly maps independent Gaussian noises to physical configurations following the inverse RG flow. The model has an exact and tractable likelihood, which allows unbiased training and direct access to the renormalized energy function of the latent variables. To train the model, we employ probability density distillation for the bare energy function of the physical problem, in which the training loss provides a variational upper bound of the physical free energy. We demonstrate practical usage of the approach by identifying mutually independent collective variables of the Ising model and performing accelerated hybrid Monte Carlo sampling in the latent space. Lastly, we comment on the connection of the present approach to the wavelet formulation of RG and the modern pursuit of information preserving RG.},

@article{liuSimulatingIsingModel2017,
	abstract = {The deep learning framework is witnessing expansive growth into diverse applications such as biological systems, human cognition, robotics, and the social sciences, thanks to its immense ability to extract essential features from complicated systems. In particular, recent developments of the field have revealed the unique faculty of deep learning to accurately approximate complex physical systems in fluid dynamics, condensed matter physics, etc. The convolutional neural network (CNN) is an efficient approach to represent complex systems with large degrees of freedom. On the other hand, the generative adversarial network (GAN), as an unsupervised learning algorithm, is capable of efficiently imitating the distribution of training data. Here we leverage this unique property of GAN, in conjunction with CNN methodology, to establish an Ising simulator whose generator can produce Ising states given temperature T around the criticality. The generated Ising states well resemble, and essentially replicate, the data from conventional Monte Carlo simulations. Our results demonstrate the universality of GAN as a promising tool in the field of computational and statistical physics.},

@article{Mehta:2018dln,
	abstract = {Machine Learning (ML) is one of the most exciting and dynamic areas of modern research and application. The purpose of this review is to provide an introduction to the core concepts and tools of machine learning in a manner easily understood and intuitive to physicists. The review begins by covering fundamental concepts in ML and modern statistics such as the bias-variance tradeoff, overfitting, regularization, generalization, and gradient descent before moving on to more advanced topics in both supervised and unsupervised learning. Topics covered in the review include ensemble models, deep learning and neural networks, clustering and data visualization, energy-based models (including MaxEnt models and Restricted Boltzmann Machines), and variational methods. Throughout, we emphasize the many natural connections between ML and statistical physics. A notable aspect of the review is the use of Python Jupyter notebooks to introduce modern ML/statistical packages to readers using physics-inspired datasets (the Ising Model and Monte-Carlo simulations of supersymmetric decays of proton-proton collisions). We conclude with an extended outlook discussing possible uses of machine learning for furthering our understanding of the physical world as well as open problems in ML where physicists may be able to contribute.

@article{mehtaExactMappingVariational2014,
	abstract = {Deep learning is a broad set of techniques that uses multiple layers of representation to automatically learn relevant features directly from structured data. Recently, such techniques have yielded record-breaking results on a diverse set of difficult machine learning tasks in computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing. Despite the enormous success of deep learning, relatively little is understood theoretically about why these techniques are so successful at feature learning and compression. Here, we show that deep learning is intimately related to one of the most important and successful techniques in theoretical physics, the renormalization group (RG). RG is an iterative coarse-graining scheme that allows for the extraction of relevant features (i.e. operators) as a physical system is examined at different length scales. We construct an exact mapping from the variational renormalization group, first introduced by Kadanoff, and deep learning architectures based on Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs). We illustrate these ideas using the nearest-neighbor Ising Model in one and two-dimensions. Our results suggests that deep learning algorithms may be employing a generalized RG-like scheme to learn relevant features from data.},

@article{nealMCMCUsingHamiltonian2012,
	abstract = {Hamiltonian dynamics can be used to produce distant proposals for the Metropolis algorithm, thereby avoiding the slow exploration of the state space that results from the diffusive behaviour of simple random-walk proposals. Though originating in physics, Hamiltonian dynamics can be applied to most problems with continuous state spaces by simply introducing fictitious "momentum" variables. A key to its usefulness is that Hamiltonian dynamics preserves volume, and its trajectories can thus be used to define complex mappings without the need to account for a hard-to-compute Jacobian factor - a property that can be exactly maintained even when the dynamics is approximated by discretizing time. In this review, I discuss theoretical and practical aspects of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, and present some of its variations, including using windows of states for deciding on acceptance or rejection, computing trajectories using fast approximations, tempering during the course of a trajectory to handle isolated modes, and short-cut methods that prevent useless trajectories from taking much computation time.},

@article{neklyudovMetropolisHastingsViewVariational2018,
	abstract = {A significant part of MCMC methods can be considered as the Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm with different proposal distributions. From this point of view, the problem of constructing a sampler can be reduced to the question -- how to choose a proposal for the MH algorithm? To address this question, we propose to learn an independent sampler that maximizes the acceptance rate of the MH algorithm, which, as we demonstrate, is highly related to the conventional variational inference. For Bayesian inference, the proposed method compares favorably against alternatives to sample from the posterior distribution. Under the same approach, we step beyond the scope of classical MCMC methods and deduce the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) framework from scratch, treating the generator as the proposal and the discriminator as the acceptance test. On real-world datasets, we improve Frechet Inception Distance and Inception Score, using different GANs as a proposal distribution for the MH algorithm. In particular, we demonstrate improvements of recently proposed BigGAN model on ImageNet.},

@article{parnoTransportMapAccelerated2018,
	abstract = {We introduce a new framework for efficient sampling from complex probability distributions, using a combination of transport maps and the Metropolis--Hastings rule. The core idea is to use deterministic couplings to transform typical Metropolis proposal mechanisms (e.g., random walks, Langevin methods) into non-Gaussian proposal distributions that can more effectively explore the target density. Our approach adaptively constructs a lower triangular transport map---an approximation of the Knothe--Rosenblatt rearrangement---using information from previous Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) states, via the solution of an optimization problem. This optimization problem is convex regardless of the form of the target distribution and can be solved efficiently without gradient information from the target probability distribution; the target distribution is instead represented via samples. Sequential updates enable efficient and parallelizable adaptation of the map even for large numbers of samples. We show that this approach uses inexact or truncated maps to produce an adaptive MCMC algorithm that is ergodic for the exact target distribution. Numerical demonstrations on a range of parameter inference problems show order-of-magnitude speedups over standard MCMC techniques, measured by the number of effectively independent samples produced per target density evaluation and per unit of wallclock time.},

Most applications of variational inference employ simple families of posterior approximations in order to allow for efficient inference, focusing on mean-field or other simple structured approximations. This restriction has a significant impact on the quality of inferences made using variational methods. We introduce a new approach for specifying flexible, arbitrarily complex and scalable approximate posterior distributions. Our approximations are distributions constructed through a normalizing flow, whereby a simple initial density is transformed into a more complex one by applying a sequence of invertible transformations until a desired level of complexity is attained. We use this view of normalizing flows to develop categories of finite and infinitesimal flows and provide a unified view of approaches for constructing rich posterior approximations. We demonstrate that the theoretical advantages of having posteriors that better match the true posterior, combined with the scalability of amortized variational approaches, provides a clear improvement in performance and applicability of variational inference.},

	abstract = {In recent years, deep artificial neural networks (including recurrent ones) have won numerous contests in pattern recognition and machine learning. This historical survey compactly summarises relevant work, much of it from the previous millennium. Shallow and deep learners are distinguished by the depth of their credit assignment paths, which are chains of possibly learnable, causal links between actions and effects. I review deep supervised learning (also recapitulating the history of backpropagation), unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning \& evolutionary computation, and indirect search for short programs encoding deep and large networks.},

@article{Springenberg:2014wtf,
	abstract = {Most modern convolutional neural networks (CNNs) used for object recognition are built using the same principles: Alternating convolution and max-pooling layers followed by a small number of fully connected layers. We re-evaluate the state of the art for object recognition from small images with convolutional networks, questioning the necessity of different components in the pipeline. We find that max-pooling can simply be replaced by a convolutional layer with increased stride without loss in accuracy on several image recognition benchmarks. Following this finding -- and building on other recent work for finding simple network structures -- we propose a new architecture that consists solely of convolutional layers and yields competitive or state of the art performance on several object recognition datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet). To analyze the network we introduce a new variant of the ``deconvolution approach'' for visualizing features learned by CNNs, which can be applied to a broader range of network structures than existing approaches.},

@software{waskomMwaskomSeabornV02017,
	abstract = {v0.8.1 (September 2017) Added a warning in {$<$}code{\$>\$}FacetGrid{\$<\$}/code{\$>\$} when passing a categorical plot function without specifying {\$<\$}code{\$>\$}order{\$<\$}/code{\$>\$} (or {\$<\$}code{\$>\$}hue\_order{\$<\$}/code{\$>\$} when {\$<\$}code{\$>\$}hue{\$<\$}/code{\$>\$} is used), which is likely to produce a plot that is incorrect. Improved compatibility between {\$<\$}code{\$>\$}FacetGrid{\$<\$}/code{\$>\$} or {\$<\$}code{\$>\$}PairGrid{\$<\$}/code{\$>\$} and interactive matplotlib backends so that the legend no longer remains inside the figure when using {\$<\$}code{\$>\$}legend\_out=True{\$<\$}/code{\$>\$}. Changed categorical plot functions with small plot elements to use {\$<\$}code{\$>\$}dark\_palette{\$<\$}/code{\$>\$} instead of `light\_palette`` when generating a sequential palette from a specified color. Improved robustness of {\$<\$}code{\$>\$}kdeplot{\$<\$}/code{\$>\$} and {\$<\$}code{\$>\$}distplot{\$<\$}/code{\$>\$} to data with fewer than two observations. Fixed a bug in {\$<\$}code{\$>\$}clustermap{\$<\$}/code{\$>\$} when using {\$<\$}code{\$>\$}yticklabels=False{\$<\$}/code{\$>\$}. Fixed a bug in {\$<\$}code{\$>\$}pointplot{\$<\$}/code{\$>\$} where colors were wrong if exactly three points were being drawn. Fixed a bug in{\$<\$}code{\$>\$}pointplot{\$<\$}/code{\$>\$} where legend entries for missing data appeared with empty markers. Fixed a bug in {\$<\$}code{\$>\$}clustermap{\$<\$}/code{\$>\$} where an error was raised when annotating the main heatmap and showing category colors. Fixed a bug in {\$<\$}code{\$>\$}clustermap{\$<\$}/code{\$>\$} where row labels were not being properly rotated when they overlapped. Fixed a bug in {\$<\$}code{\$>\$}kdeplot{\$<\$}/code{\$>\$} where the maximum limit on the density axes was not being updated when multiple densities were drawn. Improved compatibility with future versions of pandas.},

	abstract = {The normalizing constant plays an important role in Bayesian computation, and there is a large literature on methods for computing or approximating normalizing constants that cannot be evaluated in closed form. When the normalizing constant varies by orders of magnitude, methods based on importance sampling can require many rounds of tuning. We present an improved approach using adaptive path sampling, iteratively reducing gaps between the base and target. Using this adaptive strategy, we develop two metastable sampling schemes. They are automated in Stan and require little tuning. For a multimodal posterior density, we equip simulated tempering with a continuous temperature. For a funnel-shaped entropic barrier, we adaptively increase mass in bottleneck regions to form an implicit divide-and-conquer. Both approaches empirically perform better than existing methods for sampling from metastable distributions, including higher accuracy and computation efficiency.},
